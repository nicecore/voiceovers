      IDEA: Instead of underlining 'read more about me' by default, put a little icon or symbol next to it that will
      encourage the user to mouse over it, but also highlight the whole phrase and make it all clickable.

      IDEA: You need a second sentence in this blurb referencing the type of stuff you've done/can do. You still 
      need to work on this part a lot! This falls under content! Need to understand what kind of stuff you might 
      be best at marketing yourself with.
